    "The F-Test (do not confuse with ANOVA) is used in this course as a tool for the decision which test is used for the comparison of two samples. It checks for heterogeneity of variances. The test result complements the consideration of boxplots.\n",

In one such study, seven plants were treated with the substance Ancymidol (ancy) and were compared to eight control plants that were given ordinary water. Heights of all of the plants were measured, in cm, after 14 days of growth\" (see data below, Ahern, 1998, cited according to Samuels and Wittmer, 2003, p.228). Ancymidol is a growth suppressor used in agriculture as a herbicide. \n",
