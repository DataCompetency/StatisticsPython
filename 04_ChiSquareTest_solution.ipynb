    "# $\\chi^{2}$-Test\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\chi^{2}$ -test is a nonparametric test suiting for e.g. dichotomous data. Dichotomous data are a kind of discrete data. For example, Mendel's yellow or green pea color, high or low pest infestation and jagged or round shaped leaves are dichotomous end points. \n",
    "\n",
    "### $\\chi^{2}$ Goodness-of-Fit Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The  $\\chi^{2}$ Goodness-Of-Fit Test compares a measured distribution with a known, theoretical distribution. The classical example is the comparison of an empirical phenotype ratio with a predicted phenotype ratio in genetics .\n",
    "Two-sided hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_{0}: F_{0}(x) = F_{1}(x)$$\n",
    "$$H_{1}: F_{0}(x) \\neq F_{1}(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### $\\chi^{2}$ Homogeneity Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The  $\\chi^{2}$ Homogeneity Test checks whether the procentual relation of two samples is different (e.g. \\texttt{infestation} and \\texttt{no infestation} for the treatments with and without insecticide).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_{0}: \\pi_{0}(x) = \\pi_{1}(x)$$\n",
    "$$H_{1}: \\pi_{0}(x) \\neq \\pi_{1}(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Both tests might be calculated one-sided (but it's a special case, statistics software usually only contains the two-sided variant).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### $\\chi^{2}$ Goodness-of-Fit Test - <tt>scipy.stats.chisquare()</tt>\n",
    "\n",
    "The scipy module contains the function <tt>scipy.stats.chisquare()</tt>. It can be called with the following syntax for a goodness-of-fit test:\n",

    "   \n",
    "Both <tt>observed_values</tt> and <tt>expected_values</tt> should be 1-dimensional numpy arrays.\n",

    "The scipy module contains the function <tt>scipy.stats.chi2_contingency()</tt>. It can be called with the following syntax for a 2x2 homogeneity test:\n",

    "   \n",
    "where <tt>data</tt> should be 2x2 numpy array.\n",
    "\n",
    "<tt>correction</tt> states whether the Yates-correction shall be used (number of observations smaller than 20) or not. The default configuration (FALSE) calculates the original $\\chi^{2}$-test according to Pearson. \n",

    "### Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "A geneticist, investigating the Mendelian predictions for F2 generations observed the ratio of phenotypes shown in the following table for the F2 generation (Baur et al., 1931 cited according to Samuels and Wittmer, 2003, p. 392). \n",
