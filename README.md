There here contained course material servers the purpose of teaching how to do statistics with Python at University of Greifswald.

In your JupyterHub, open a Terminal window and execute the following code:

    git clone https://github.com/KatharinaHoff/StatisticsPython.git

Most chapters in this course were created by using the R-Handbook for Biostatistics (http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/bioinf/katharina/bsc/RManual_English.pdf) and replacing R code by Python code.
